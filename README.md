# LolKey's Algorithm-Library
This library ~contains~ will soon contain all of the algorithms and data-structures i use on a daily basis during competitive programming competitions and my other projects.
Each algorithm/data-structure implementation contains a short description of how it works, and a time complexity analysis.
Some implementations might use others, so it is advised to use the whole library (when it gets included) instead of individual files.
